# RiskReporting

ASP.NET MVC Core 2.0 Project

Non-Microsoft Dependencies: -
* BuildBundlerMinifier (2.4.337)
* WebMarkupMin.AspNetCore2 (2.4.2)
* EPPlus (5.3.1)

Notes: -
Displays a web form requesting two files (one Excel report file and one XML data file).
Submission generates the resulting report(s).

Possible Improvements: -
* Improved error handling
* Additional logging
* Input validation
* Unit Tests
    - Apologies for the missing Unit tests, NUnit/Moq integration would have taken too much additional time.
